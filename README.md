## DataStructures

### What is this repository for?

This repository is for my study in data structures. I use both C and C++ to write the programs.

### What does this repository have?

There are the source code implementing some data structures and the conclusions for the data structures in this repository. Also there are some personal thinking when programming and some bugs encountered with their solutions. In the future, there may be some project for practice.
